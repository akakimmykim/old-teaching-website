			<h1> WHY DOES HE TEACH </h1>
			<div class="writing">
				<h3> "Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach." </h3>
				<h3> - Aristotle </h3>
				<p>
					Once Andrew understands, he teaches to understand it better for himself and his students. </br>
					In class, he often thinks to himself, "if only he/she said it this way...." Knowing and hating the shortcomings
					of classroom education, Andrew turns teaching into a <b> personalized experience </b>so that his students
					easily absorb and enjoy what they learn.

		<div class="section" id="what">
			<h1> WHAT IS TEACHING </h1>
			<div class="writing">
				<p>
					Getting an education is not learning. Going to school is not studying. </br>
					Telling someone something is not teaching.
					<b>Teaching is building a relationship</b>. Empathizing,
					adapting, and encouraging is, therefore, essential to great teaching.  </br> </br>
					Andrew believes that <b>classroom education</b>
					<b> limits what a student can do</b>. Contrary to this, he treats his students as
					<b>gifted individuals</b>, setting the bar just a little higher so his students can improve themselves.
				</p>
				<h1> WHAT IS A TEACHER </h1>
				<div class="writing">
					<p>
						Andrew believes that a teacher is an older brother or sister. </br> A teacher is someone
						who leads by example, understands circumstances, gives a helping hand, and inspires
						a better version of oneself.

			<h1> HOW DOES HE TEACH </h1>
			<div class="writing">
					<h3>Class is relationship building. </h3>
					<p>Andrew always begins class by asking how the day and week has been for his student,
					trying to get to know the student as a person. He often also shares about a quick event so the
					student knows that his/her teacher isn't a robot. He also asks about his <b> student's interests </b>so that
					he can bring up analogies that are familiar to that student.</p>
					<h3> Teaching considers learning styles.</h3>
					<p>Andrew gets his student to take a quick quiz on <a href'"http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml">
					learning styles </a> because he will use that information to cater his teaching style to his student. His teaching, however, is not limited
					to his student's learning style. He makes sure to go over material in as many different ways as necessary.</p>
					<h3> Help doesn't stop because class ends </h3>
					<p>Andrew always makes time to <b> answer questions </b> that students send him via email or other social media. He encourages students
					to resolve confusions ASAP by contacting him. Students in Malaysia still ask him questions even though
					he cannot teach them anymore.</p>
					<h3> Learning Beyond the Subject </h3>
					<p>Andrew makes sure to bring in tips on how to study and other <b> life advice</b>, especailly to younger kids who 
					are nervous about how their futures will turn out. Learning about what goes on outside of school is invaluable
					to succeeding in life but is often missing in school education.</p>
