			<h3> Metallic Organic Frameworks Research </h3>
			<img src="metalorganicframework.jpg"> </img>
			<p>
				Together with Dr. Richard Kyung and Mr. Woong Jae Baek, we conducted research on 
					<b> metal organic frameworks </b> used in optoelectronics. The efficiency of
					the optoelectronic devices were observed after changing the particles' structure. Gaussian and ChemCraft 
					were used to guage the stability and effiency. </br>

		<h3> This Website! </h3>
			<img src="website.JPG"> </img>
			<p>
				It is as you see it - a <b class="R"> work in progress!</b> </br>
				I designed this website using HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 and Javascript. In order to do so, I watched YouTube tutorials, searched many Googles, and asked professional friends 
				to get to where it is today. </br>
				<b>Improvements to come!</b> </br>

			<h3> Dalat International School Strategic Plan </h3>
			<img src="strategicplan.jpg"> </img>
			<p>
				As the president of the student council, the head of school invited me to <b> represent the student body </b> in coming up
						with their 5 year strategic plan. I surveyed students, helped build the vision and mission statements, and argued
						against teacher-centric changes. This plan has been in effect for a year, and I still contact the school about their progress. </br>

			<p>
				The Refugees in-Flight Shelter Kit (RIFSK) is a light-weight, fully biodegradable, and sturdy structure that 
				can fit a 1.6m tall mother and her two children. I was a part of the <b> management team </b>that facillitated communication between the groups.
				I was also the sewing teacher and center for purchasing and communication. I also designed the RIFSK website. </br>

			<h3> Fluorination </h3>

			<p>
				In order to satiate high-schoolers' and college students's desire for a quick and inuitive answer to their
						questions, my hackathon team and I created <b> Fluorination </b>. The goal of Fluorination is to incentivize 
						information sharing platform that is <b class="R"> from students to students </b>. This website won Best Use of Algolia
						during HackCooper2018.</br>

		<h3> TetrHiss </h3>
			<img src="tetrhiss.jpg"> </img>
			<p>
				Using C++, I developed a <b class="R"> mashup game between Snake and Tetrhiss </b>. Many times more difficult than Snake and Tetrhiss alone,
						this game takes patience as well as planning. </br> The snake moves and has to eat 4 randomly spawning food items.
						On the fourth snack, whatever shape it is will be the tetris shape you can move. </br>
